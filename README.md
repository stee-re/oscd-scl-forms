```

## Testing with Web Test Runner

> This demo plugin does nothing much that could be tested as it relies exclusively on built-in browser components to do its job. We therefore currently have no tests. If you find something that could be tested, please feel free!

To execute a single test run:

```bash
npm run test
```

To run the tests in interactive watch mode run:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.

## Local Demo with `web-dev-server`

```bash
npm run start
```

To run a local development server that serves the basic demo located in `demo/index.html`
